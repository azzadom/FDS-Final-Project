# Pathology Detection in Crop Plants  

## Overview  
This project investigates automated classification of diseases in apple leaves using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Leveraging a high-quality image dataset, we combine traditional machine learning models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop scalable methods for plant disease detection. The proposed approaches support technology-driven solutions for sustainable agriculture.

## Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle competition: [Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7). It contains 1,821 labeled images of apple leaves categorized into four classes:  

- **Healthy**: No visible symptoms of disease.  
- **Rust**: Fungal infections with rust-like symptoms.  
- **Scab**: Fungal lesions causing scab-like patterns.  
- **Multiple Diseases**: Symptoms of more than one disease present.

## Methodology  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Class Distribution:** Visualized using pie charts and histograms, highlighting the imbalance in the "Multiple Diseases" class.  
- **Color Analysis:** Computed RGB histograms and channel statistics to identify class-specific patterns in leaf images.  

### Preprocessing  
- **Edge Detection:** Applied Canny filtering to isolate leaf regions and remove background noise.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted RGB histograms and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features for machine learning models.  
- **Data Augmentation:** Addressed class imbalance through synthetic oversampling and geometric transformations.  

### Machine Learning Models  
1. **Softmax Regression:** Baseline multiclass prediction model.  
2. **Random Forest:** Ensemble learning method to improve accuracy.  

### Deep Learning Models  
1. **ResNet-50**  
   - Fine-tuned residual connections to capture complex hierarchical features.  
   - Addressed gradient issues through skip connections.  
2. **VGG-16**  
   - Optimized sequential layers for extracting fine-grained patterns.  
   - Balanced depth and simplicity for efficient classification.
